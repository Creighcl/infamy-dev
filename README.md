# Infamy.dev Website
Allows developers to create a leaderboard and send high scores to it via HTTP web requests. 

## Stack
- Data Storage: Firebase Realtime Database
- HTTP Endpoints: Firebase Serverless Functions
- Hosting: Firebase Hosting
- Front End: ReactJS (CRA)

## Leaderboard Security
In the current version: there isn't any. Pretty easy for a mildly web savvy individual to 'figure out' how to manipulate the board.
