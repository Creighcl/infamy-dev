Allows developers to create a scoreboard and send high scores to it via HTTP web requests. Developers can then link to [scoreboard on Infamy](https://infamy.dev/highscore/web?id=example) or download the scoreboard via [xml](https://infamy.dev/highscore/xml?id=example) or [json](https://infamy.dev/highscore/json?id=example) and display within their own projects.
