# [Infamy.dev](https://www.infamy.dev) Roadmap
Wrote this to facilitate a quick and easy way to incorporate score boards into game jam games. It's not super robust, but doesn't currently need to be.

If we wanted to get fancy with it, here's some ideas for future iterations:

#### Allow users to login to website and 'Claim' ownership of boards
Allow owners of boards to customize properties of the board:
- Keep top X players' high scores (currently 100)
- Change score mode to keep all top scores submitted (currently shows best for each player)
- Change ranking mode: Standard Competition "1224", Modified competition "1334", Dense "1223" (current), or Ordinal "1234"
- Set encryption key and turn encrypted score submissions on/off


### Slightly different board types
- Accrual boards would add score submissions to the player's current score
- Recent rank board would track best score in last X hours
- Team board would expect addtl 'team' key and would display standings by team aggregation
